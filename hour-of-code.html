        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The Hour of Code is a global initiative designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of coding and
            computational thinking.
            Our event aimed to spark interest in programming among seventh-grade students, fostering a love for
            problem-solving and technology.

            <p>Date: November 7th, 2024<br>Time: 10:45 - 12:35<br>Place: School ‚Ññ214<br>Pupils: 21</p>
            <p>
                The event was held in a classroom equipped with interactive tools to engage the students effectively.
                Despite the small space, we made the most of it, ensuring every participant could actively contribute.

                Through preparation was key to the success of the event. From securing permissions to designing
                interactive activities,
                we ensured everything was aligned with the students‚Äô needs. Each team member rehearsed their roles,
                including presentations, demonstrations, and technical assistance.

                Our hands-on approach introduced students to algorithms and basic coding concepts. Through interactive
                activities,
                they created simple algorithms and solved coding challenges using step-by-step instructions, sparking
                curiosity and excitement.

        <h2>Feedback & Highlights</h2>
        <p>
            The students were thrilled to discover how coding works in real-life scenarios. Many found debugging to be
            the most exciting part,
            as they learned how to resolve errors step-by-step. One participant shared, ‚ÄúI never thought coding could be
            so much fun and creative!‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
            Teachers also expressed interest in integrating similar activities into their regular curriculum to enhance
            student engagement in STEM fields.

        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>
            Inspired by the success of this event, we plan to organize follow-up workshops and mentoring sessions for
            students who wish to dive deeper into coding.
            Future events will focus on topics like web development, game design, and artificial intelligence, offering
            practical exposure to advanced technologies.
